What would it be like to turn into a mermaid? To feel the same blood flow in your fingers as in the tips of your tail?

Samantha wasn't expecting to find out when she rescued what she thought was a drowning woman, only to have the tides turned. And she certainly wasn't prepared for the depth of the changes as she sank more deeply- and more irreversibly- into the mermaid's world.

_(Rescued from an old hard drive!)_

Amy thought the worst thing that could happen on a bad night out was an awkward rejection. Instead, she meets a witch who wants a friend, a ride, and help becoming a mermaid.

The magic works. Just not the way it’s supposed to.

A story about unintended transformations, sapphic tension, bad decisions made with good intentions, and what happens when someone else’s dream rewrites your life.
